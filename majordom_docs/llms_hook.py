"""MkDocs hook: fold the example-integration full-source dumps into the LLM index.

``mkdocs-llmstxt`` builds ``llms.txt`` (index of doc pages) and ``llms-full.txt`` from the docs.
This hook runs after that and, for each source in ``llms_sources.yml`` that has a generated
``docs/llms/<name>.txt`` (produced by ``scripts/build_llms.py`` and copied to ``site/llms/`` by
MkDocs), it:

- appends an "Example Integrations (full source)" section to ``llms.txt`` linking the unindexed
  ``/llms/<name>.txt`` endpoints, and
- appends each full dump to ``llms-full.txt``.

The dumps are served as raw ``.txt`` (not in the nav, not HTML), so they stay out of the site's
search index and are reachable only via ``llms.txt``.
