"""Weekly change-check for the integration llms endpoints.

Compares each source repo's current HEAD (GitHub API) against the SHA recorded in the *live*
site's ``/llms/manifest.json`` (published by the last deploy). If any repo has advanced — or the
manifest is missing — it triggers a docs redeploy via ``publish.yml``, which re-packs and
republishes. Nothing is cloned or committed here.

Needs the ``gh`` CLI with ``GH_TOKEN`` in the environment (both provided in GitHub Actions).
